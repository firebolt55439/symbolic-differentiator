TODO:

x^{3xy}+e^{i\pi }+\frac{3}{\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)}+x^{z^3-2w}+\frac{2}{3}
x^2ye^{\frac{y}{z}}
-x-e^{2-3x}+e^{-2x}

3 Bugs: \sin \left(x\right)^{x^{\frac{2}{-x}}}
 - simplify -1 times variable
 - simplify variable multiplication (e.g x^2 instead of xx)
 - simplify constants (-2 instead of -2/1)

=======
Fix partial power in icon, fold multiple partials in row by power
Implement generic cancellation in fractions (e.g. (a1 * a2 * ... * an) / (b1 * b2 * ... * bn))
>>>>>>> be899ea7464540b1dc391a28f05b33d9cac3379c
Implement cancellation in conjunction with multiplication (a * 1/a = 1) --> test case: x^{3xy}

Find gradient with respect to detected variables
Find all mixed partial derivatives to arbitrary order (fxx, fxy, fyy, fyx)
Solve implicitly defined relations efficiently using the Implicit Function Theorem (no need for wonky chain rule stuff that way)
	-> Implement in Scheme, move everything to one side, use make-div, optimize

Improve web interface
Add sidebar with sample derivatives (make them super ugly seeming / hard and ensure they all work)
Add view in WolframAlpha button / shortcut
