# Need to install firebase-tools so that the deploy works
dependencies:
  pre:
    - npm install -g firebase-tools

# Need to tell Circle CI how to build the site
compile:
  override:
    - bundle exec jekyll build --verbose

# Circle CI expects some kind of testing to pass in order for the
# build to be successful and deploy. Since you don't have tests
# you can fake it by just returning true. http://gph.is/1MLPDWK
test:
  override:
    - "true"

# How you tell Circle to deploy to Firebase. The important thing to
# note here is the FIREBASE_TOKEN env variable. See below.
deployment:
  production:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_TOKEN --non-interactive
